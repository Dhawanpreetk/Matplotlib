# Matplotlib Project

This Project is about  compliting the data from a most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

**This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:**
Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.
 
 # Bar Graph

 The bar graph demonstrates that the Drug Regimen, Capomulin had the highest mouse count 230, while Zoniferol had the lowest mice count 182. 
 
 # Line Graph 
 It depicts that for a Mouse id l509 with the number of days the tumor also decrease and the drug used is Capomulin.
 
 # Pie Chart 
 Clearly depicts the Male mouse percentage is more than the female mouse percentage in this Clinical Study_
 
 
 # Correlation coefficent is 0.84
 This means there is a strong relationship between the weight of the mouse and the tumor volume .Higher the weight higher is the volume of the tumor we can see this analysis for specifically the Mouse wh have been treated with Capomulin Drug

#Capomulin Drug is the treatment that is more effective in the treatment of the tumor.
